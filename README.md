### Overview of the project
### Data Processing

### Objective 
The primary objective of data preprocessing is to prepare the raw data for analysis and modeling by cleaning and transforming it into a suitable format. This involves handling missing values, detecting and correcting errors, normalizing data, and ensuring that the data is in a consistent and usable state for further machine learning tasks.

### Key Activities
**Data Cleaning**-Data cleaning involves several steps to ensure that the dataset is accurate, complete, and ready for analysis including Handling Missing Values,Removing Duplicates,Outlier Detection.
**Data Transformation**- Data transformation involves modifying the data to improve its suitability for analysis and modeling includes Feature Selection,Data Splitting,Feature Scaling.
**Data Visualization**-Data visualization helps to understand the underlying patterns, relationships, and distributions within the data through graphical representations.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data using histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

### Technologies Used
**Python**: The programming language used for data preprocessing.
**Pandas**: A data manipulation library used for handling data frames.
**NumPy**: A library used for numerical operations.
**Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Libraries used for data visualization.
**Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library used for data splitting and scaling.

### Key Insights
**Data Quality**: Initial inspection reveals the presence of missing values and duplicates which need to be addressed.
**Data Distribution**: Histograms and box plots provide insights into the distribution and potential outliers in the data.
**Correlation**: Heatmap reveals the correlation between different features, which can help in feature selection for the model.
**Feature Importance**: Scatter plots with 'Glucose' as the y-axis provide insights into how other features might relate to diabetes outcomes.

### Goal
Effective data preprocessing is crucial for building a reliable and accurate machine learning model. By cleaning the data, handling missing values, removing duplicates, scaling features, and understanding the data through EDA, we ensure that the dataset is ready for further modeling and analysis tasks.
